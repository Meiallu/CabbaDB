# CabbaDB

CabbaDB is a Java key-value database designed for simplicity and ease of use, serving both in-memory and disk-based storage requirements inspired on Redis.

# Setup

Setting up our software is a breeze. Just head over to the 'releases' section on GitHub, grab our .jar installer, and run it on your Linux machine. It will take care of all the configuration automatically. If you're using a different operating system, rest assuredâ€”the configuration files will be conveniently placed in the same directory where you ran the installer.

# Importing

For importing, you have two options:

**Gradle**
```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'me.meiallu.client:client:0.1'
}
```

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
